## Subject: Gathering Requirements for Fin-Tech Product

Dear Joe, 

We are looking forward to working with you on your fin-tech product. In order to make the integration as smooth as possible, we need to understand the nature of the transaction flows, which will influence our integration.

We need to know how many different transaction flows there are, the volume and velocity of the flows, and how different they are from one another. This will help us decide if we need to set up a streaming/real-time endpoint or just do a nightly batch upload. This could help us decide how much infrastructure we need to provision for this. It will also help us decide if we need a single schema for all the transactions, or if they are different enough to need multiple schemas.
A schema would be the details invloved in a transaction, and knowing that, for each flow, will help us in the planning and implementation of our solution.

We understand that the project is already behind schedule and over budget. We are keen to make sure that this doesnâ€™t become a bigger issue and we want to make sure we get the requirements right the first time.

If you could provide us with the information we need, we can make sure that we get the integration done as quickly and efficiently as possible. 

Looking forward to hearing from you. 

Regards, 
Emanuel
